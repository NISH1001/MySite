Hello, I am **[Nishan Pantha]** and this is the blog i made using django (a python-based web framework).

I am studying Bachelor in Computer Engineering at **[Central Campus, Institute of Engineering, TU]**.  
I have been using python as my primary programming language for 3 years now; I use django as my web framework.  
Recently I am working on **Data Science**, **AI**

#### Interests

#### I believe:  
> *Programming is more than just elegant code. It's where your mind meets fun.*  
> *To be able to fill up the void canvas with not just paints but efficient imagination.*  
> *And imagination becomes efficient when you live up to realize your dreams.*  
> *"**Dreams! you say!**" is nothing but the way a pessimist longs to see the sparks in an eternal darkness*  
> *"**My friend**" this is what I believe when I automate an entry of codes with handful of skills and boundless imagination*
